# 🌦️ Smart Drying Rack System using Arduino

This project is a smart automation system designed to **extend or retract a clothes drying rack** based on real-time environmental conditions. It utilizes **temperature**, **humidity**, **rain detection**, and **obstacle detection** to make intelligent decisions—helping you dry clothes efficiently while preventing exposure to rain or obstruction.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **DHT22 Sensor** to monitor **temperature and humidity**
- 🌧️ **Rain detection** using a push button (simulated rain sensor)
- 🧱 **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** to detect nearby obstacles
- ⚙️ **Servo Motor Control** for rack movement
- 🧠 Smart logic-based automation
- 📟 Real-time feedback on Serial Monitor

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- If it's **raining** or an **obstacle is detected**, the rack is **retracted**.
- If **temperature ≥ 25°C** and **humidity ≤ 70%**, and there's **no rain or obstacle**, the rack is **extended**.
- Otherwise, the rack remains **retracted**.

### ✅ Decision Logic

IF (Rain detected OR Obstacle detected)
-> Retract drying rack
ELSE IF (Temperature ≥ 25°C AND Humidity ≤ 70%)
-> Extend drying rack
ELSE
-> Retract drying rack

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. Connect all components according to the pin configuration above.
2. Upload the Arduino code from `smart_drying_rack.ino` using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open **Serial Monitor** at 9600 baud rate to view live sensor data and system status.
4. Observe how the rack extends or retracts based on sensor inputs.

## ⌛ Timing and Delays

- The system reads sensors and updates every **2 seconds** using `delay(2000)`.
- Ultrasonic distance is calculated using `pulseIn()`.

## 📈 Sample Serial Output

Humidity: 61.20% Temperature: 28.50°C
Obstacle Distance: 34.22 cm
Rain Detected: No
Rack Extended: Conditions Suitable for Drying


## 📦 Future Enhancements

- Replace push button with a **real rain sensor module (YL-83 or FC-37)**
- Add **Wi-Fi or Bluetooth** support for remote monitoring or alerts
- Integrate a **solar intensity sensor** for optimal drying decisions
- Include an **OLED or LCD display** for local visual feedback
- Add **mobile app integration** or **web dashboard**
- Use **weather forecast API** for predictive actions
